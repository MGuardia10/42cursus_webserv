# 42cursus_webserv

Webserv is a lightweight HTTP/1.1 server written in C++ that supports essential web functionalities, including: Handling GET, POST, and DELETE requests, cookies management, CGIs (Common Gateway Interface) execution and custom configurations via configuration file. It supports the following features:
- **Multi-client** support using non-blocking I/O
- **Static file serving** (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.)
- Dynamic content execution via **CGI** scripts
- **Request** parsing and **response** generation
- Error handling with **custom error pages**
- Basic session management via **cookies**
- **Custom configuration** for defining virtual hosts, ports, and CGI settings

To see a list of all the possible configurations supported by the project, check out the [WIKI](https://github.com/MGuardia10/42cursus_webserv/wiki/Configuration-File-and-Supported-Directives).

- `fclean`: removes obj directory with objects files and webserv binary.
- `r or run`: compiles the program and launchs it with a default configuration file.
- `v or valgrind`: compiles the program and launchs it with a default configuration file using Valgrind.
- `nd or no_debug`: compiles the program and launchs it without debug prints.
- `siege`: compiles the program, launchs it and use siege to stress test the server.
